BSNL Introduces Rs 2 Prepaid Plan Extension Offer, All You Should Know.','BSNL has been impressive with launching new plans for its various services at a rapid pace.\r\nThe state-owned telco earlier allowed its users to pay Rs 19 and extend the validity of \r\ntheir plan. Now, the telco is out with yet another offer of Rs 2 which will allow the users to extend\r\nthe validity of their existing prepaid plan. Isn’t that a treat for customers \r\nwho for some reason can’t recharge with a new prepaid plan as soon as the validity of their existing plan ends.\r\nBut the extension is not unlimited obviously, there is a certain grace period for the extension of validity.\r\n\r\nRs 2 Prepaid Plan Extension from BSNL\r\n\r\nThe latest offer from BSNL coming for Rs 2 will allow the customers to extend the validity of \r\ntheir existing plan. The grace period for the extension of validity is three days. However, \r\nit is important to note that there are no other benefits offered apart from this.
